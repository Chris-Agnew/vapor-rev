<h2>Vapor Rev site created with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. I used Next.js so when it becomes an E-Commerce site, it will be much easier than starting from scratch. I am in process of adding Google My Business API but needs manual review from Google so I put dummy data in now but will import 150 reviews when I get access to GMB API. Will update in next few days.</h2>
