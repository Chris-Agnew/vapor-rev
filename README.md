<h2>Vapor Rev site created with Next.js and tailwindcss. I used Next.js so when and if it becomes an e-commerce site it will be much easier than starting from scratch. I would like to add reviews section from google. **Once I have access to Google My Business API, I will map through the reviews and render them on screen.** </h2>
